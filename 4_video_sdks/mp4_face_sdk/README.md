### Face Detection

Facial recognition technology is now widely used in various fields including face access control systems, face payment, and more. With the improvement of facial recognition technology, its application is becoming more and more extensive. Currently, China's facial recognition technology has already taken a leading position in the world. In the security industry, mainstream security manufacturers in China have also launched their own facial recognition products and solutions. The pan-security industry is the main application field for facial recognition technology.
Facial recognition is a popular research field in computer technology. It belongs to biometric recognition technology and distinguishes individuals based on biological characteristics of the organism (usually referring to humans).
Biometric features studied by biometric recognition technology include face, fingerprint, palm print, iris, retina, sound (voice), body shape, personal habits (such as keystroke strength and frequency, signature), etc. Corresponding recognition technologies include face recognition, fingerprint recognition, palm print recognition, iris recognition, retina recognition, speech recognition (speech recognition can be used for both identity recognition and speech content recognition, only the former belongs to biometric recognition technology), body shape recognition, keystroke recognition, signature recognition, etc.

## SDK function

Read local MP4 files and detect faces in real-time (requires a desktop with a graphics card, otherwise it may be more laggy).

## Running the face detection example

1. First download the example code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mymagicpower/AIAS.git
```

2.Import the examples project into the IDE:
```
cd mp4_face_sdk
```

3. Run the example code: MP4FaceDetectionExample


## The effect is as follows:
