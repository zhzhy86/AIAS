### Mask Detection

Mask detection helps fight against pneumonia, and artificial intelligence technology is being applied to epidemic prevention and control. Wearing masks has become one of the most important measures to cut off transmission routes in the fight against the epidemic. However, in actual scenes, there are still people who do not take it seriously, do not pay attention, and have a lucky mentality who do not wear masks, especially in public places, which poses great risk to individuals and the public. The mask detection function based on artificial intelligence can perform real-time detection based on camera video stream.

## SDK function

Read local MP4 files and perform real-time (requires a desktop computer with a graphics card, otherwise it will be more sluggish) mask detection.

## Running the Example

1. Download the example code first
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mymagicpower/AIAS.git
```

2. Import the example project into the IDE:
```
cd mp4_facemask_sdk
```

3. Run the example code: MP4FaceMaskDetectionExample


## The result is as follows:
