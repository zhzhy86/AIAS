### Mask Detection

Mask detection helps fight against pneumonia. Artificial intelligence technology is being applied to epidemic prevention and control. Wearing masks has become one of the most important measures in cutting off transmission routes. However, there are still people who do not wear masks due to lack of attention or a sense of luck in actual scenarios, especially in public places, which poses great risks to individuals and the public. AI-based mask detection function can conduct real-time detection based on camera video stream.

## SDK function

Read the local camera for real-time (requires a desktop with a graphics card, otherwise it will be a bit stuck) mask detection.

## Example of running face detection

1. Download the example code first
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mymagicpower/AIAS.git
```

2. Import the example project into the IDE:
```
cd camera_facemask_sdk
```

3. Run the example code: CameraFaceMaskDetectionExample


## The effect is as follows:
