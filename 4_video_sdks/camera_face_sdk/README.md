### Face Detection

Facial recognition technology has been widely used in various industries including face access control systems, facial payment, and more. With the advancement of facial recognition technology, its applications are becoming more and more widespread. Currently, China's facial recognition technology is leading the world, and mainstream security manufacturers in China have also launched their own facial recognition products and solutions. The security industry is the main application area for facial recognition technology.
Facial recognition is a popular research field in computer technology. It belongs to the category of biometric recognition technology, which distinguishes individuals by their biological features (generally referring to humans). The biometric features studied by biometric recognition technology include face, fingerprint, palm print, iris, retina, voice (speech), body shape, personal habits (such as typing force and frequency, signature), etc. The corresponding recognition technologies are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, palm print recognition, iris recognition, retina recognition, speech recognition (voice recognition can be used for identity recognition or speech content recognition, only the former belongs to biometric recognition technology), body shape recognition, keyboard typing recognition, signature recognition, and so on.

## SDK Functionality

Read the local camera and detect faces in real-time (a desktop computer with a graphics card is required, otherwise it will be laggy).

## Run the face detection example

1. First download the example code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mymagicpower/AIAS.git
```

2. Import the example project into the IDE:
```
cd camera_face_sdk
```

3. Run the example code: CameraFaceDetectionExample


## The effect is as follows:
